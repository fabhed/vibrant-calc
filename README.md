To implement a calculator with colorful buttons, we will use Python with the Tkinter library for the GUI. The architecture will consist of the following files:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of the Calculator class and start the Tkinter event loop.

2. `calculator.py`: This file will contain the Calculator class. The Calculator class will be responsible for creating the GUI and handling user input.

3. `button.py`: This file will contain the Button class. The Button class will represent a button on the calculator. It will have a color property and a command property.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file will list the dependencies of the project.

Let's start with the `main.py` file:
